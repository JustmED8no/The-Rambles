            <p> The Long and Short of this.
              This is my Site where I Rant, inform, or argue about about anything that happens to light
              my idea bulb on fire. Though most of my content is random and has no order in terms of topic
              or reasons, I do mainly rant about,<br><a href="My Ramblings.html" id="AnimeRants">,Anime</a><a href="Gaming.html" id="TheGame">Gaming </a>             and My life (coming soon) as these are the things I'm most familiar with and of course, have the most stuff
            to rant about. Yes this is kinda like a blog as it could never be a news site, informing my readers of the lastest
            whatnot as my information gathering skills are absolute trash in every form of the word, however, I'll rant
            about all that and more ,later. For now I welcome you to my best attempt at a website so far, and as I
             find the drive to update it and finally add my three column format, I will be sure to post about
             useless information and my life happened in hopes of giving you a smile and giving me something to.
             Anyways, that was the long and short of it.

<h1> I SOO NEED MORE STUFF TO PUT HERE 
</h1><h2>(MINI LIFE I GUESSS)</h2>
 <p> ok,ok,ok, i'll admit, the black is annoying. I had a mini stroke trying to come up with a nice background color of some kind and to be honest, for me to do that, i would need to change a lot of the fonts, and colors of a lot of the text here, to be frank, i have no intention of removing my awesome background gif.
  You'll never believe the trouble I went through to even figure out that it was possible. And no, i'm not a professional if you couldn't tell
  i'm new to this site building thing, and though I have a great understanding and overall love for code and anything
  remotely related to such a topic,that doesn't mean i'm good, not yet, and that doesn't mean i'm willing to dump
  my free time to do site and break my spinal cord to code all day, although, if I had nothing better to... and i was given a reward
  I might consider being a productive teen for once and work on it more. but as you'll see in later posts,
  My plate is full. not just of actual work but of stuff I want to do before I sleep each night. Eating is one of them.
  But overall I will attempt to push through and make this site something I can be proud of. Though, I might regret
  ever putting that promise in my mind.

  <h1> I little about me to Kill time</h1>

  <p> So, my name is Dino, JustmeD8no, or as the girls in school call me, weirdo. I'm not fully attached to the
    last one but i'll take marketing and free advertising where I can. I'm overall, your everyday, rando kid
    who has lots of free time for all the wrong reasons. For one, I've been single all my life. considering i've
    Having been living for only a few years, I see my being single as a win for both man and law. I'm also a member of
    the shy introvert and 'needs to study more' club in life, along with owning the highly rare badge of semi-picky eater.
    but apart from those normal everyday traits, I think i'm awfully normal and average, we don't mention my looks though,
    THAT'S NOT A CURRENT TALKING POINT.<BR> I'm a gamer too! not a truly hard-core one but not a casual one either.
      more of the...average range of gamer and fellow console enjoyer. Speaking of games, I'm also a fellow meme
      enjoyer and honored sleep consumer, getting an amazing 8 hours of sleep every other ish day. In this day
      and age, I consider that a huge flex.
