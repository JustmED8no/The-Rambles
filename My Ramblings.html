<h1 class="Heading"> Anyways, welcome I guess</h1>
<br><p> today we shall be reflecting on what i got myself into. Like for real, I'm not in the mood
     for a reflection session, but i will say this.
</p>
<br><p> I just want to find another good anime</p>
<br><p>In truth all I want right now (rn) is something worth watching, something worth my time.
    To be fair, i've spent way to much time already grinding every possible (Good) anime I could afford to bless my ears and eyes with, and of recently
    I have let anime bless my heart with it's very presence as I have been very much addicted to romance anime
</p>
<p>And I regret.....</p>
 NOTHING! About my decision and addiction.
 </body>
 <body class="body1">
<br><br><hr><P> but, this is where my problems start. unfortunately.</P>
<H2 class="heading"> IN THE BEGINNING, THERE WAS ME AND ANIME!</H2>
<BR>
<p>When it comes to me and anime, there are a few things to note and remember about me</p>
<ul>
<li class="list"> I'm an On/ Off anime addict</li><img src="Screenshot (89).png" height="500">
<li class="list"> my taste in anime is both good and bad</li><img src="download.jpeg" height="500">
<li class="list"> I'm a 16 year old loner</li><img src="Screenshot (91).png" height="500">
<p> and...</p>
<li class="list"> I'm a level quality watcher</li><img src="Screenshot (94).png" height="500">
</ol>
<br><p> I'll explain the points as we move along and as i rememeber more points to add</p>
<br><p>But anyways, these points are huge factors to my liking of an anime or any show in general.
    With my not soo perfect taste in anime and this bascially meaning I will go throught huge anime type phases,
    like one time i'll love horror, next time i'll have a crush on everything romance (my current situation), other times, harem is my go to,
    sometimes, thriller is what gets my blood pumping and soo on and so forth. However, this isn't like a timed even 
    as far as I know, it's actually, a revelation swap, like, I'll find and anime that fits my current addiction
    and stuff and watch it, love it, move on,
    However, if i do some searching , which is how i find anime on the whole, and locate an anime outside
    of my current addiction and i love it, I;ll swap my addiction to that kind of anime. But this is where my other problem comes
    in. My level quality addiction.
</p>
<br><p> For me to swap animes like that or the gerne ( i fogot how to spell it) i have to be 
    introduced to an anime that's equally as good or better then
    the current anime i was watching, which, If i'm starting from the ground up isn't bad, but, 
    i'm use to watching 7 mal score, 
    8 mal score and 9 mal score anime and even
    ( atleast to me) some master pecies like bruh!!
    
</p>
<img src="download.png">
<p> This is a huge problem to me and to any other anime addicts (watchers) out there,though,
    before you can fully understand how serious this situation is, I think i should
    enlighten you about what mal is and all that stuff.<br> MAL or my anime list.com, is an anime listing
    website, thought simple in appearance to any un-informed weeb, it is actually the site that determines
    if an anime is good or bad. because of its millions of users with fan bases of all kinds, and the simple
    yet effective rating system, it widely believed that the weebs and anime lovers of the world have rated
    every anime, out there and put their results on MAL. Acting as a warning  to avoid or invitation
     to watch for all thoses who use the site or simply want a good anime. MAL's power is so strong,
     that it's ratings of anime are trusted more by the anime watching community than the official sites some
     of the anime themselves were originally posted on. And of course, this power is not false,
     as, because of te huge user base and the ever growing population of anime watchers joining the clan, the
     ratings on anime on MAL are nothing but perfect. Or, at least very accurate. Using a 1-10 system, animes can be
     1-very bad,2-bad,3-Meh,4-boring,5-OK,6-Good,7-great,8-awesome,9-perfect and 10, masterpiece. ( note, the ratings aren't word for word but basically
     mean the same thing. google it). So to this extent, it's obvious to see mals power. However, the problem isn't mal
     but the anime as they are only so many good anime out there and because of my level quality watching habit
     and refusal to watch anything that isn't on the same level or higher than my previous series and my requirements to
     anime hop, you see where my problem is. plus, i have a bone to pick with Nathtalia from Rising of a Shield Hero,
     But, we have other things to address.
